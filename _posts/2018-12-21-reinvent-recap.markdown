December started with another edition of the re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.  My colleagues and I have started a tour around dozens of cities around the world to offer a re:Invent re:Cap, check your [local AWS User Group on Meetup][meetupAWS]{:target="_blank"} for details.

In France, we covered the following cities, with the help of our partners [D2Si](https://www.d2si.io/){:target="_blank"} and [CoreExpert (by TeamWorks)](http://www.corexpert.net/){:target="_blank"} :

- [Paris](https://twitter.com/d2si/status/1072194945803534337){:target="_blank"} (Monday, 10th December)
- [Toulouse](https://twitter.com/d2siToulouse/status/1074746986002309121){:target="_blank"} (Monday, 17th December)
- [Lyon](https://twitter.com/d2si/status/1075096028330844163){:target="_blank"} (Tuesday, 18th of December)

[Let me know][me] if you want to add a city and date in January.

Developer's often asked me what was my favourite announcement from the 100+ made that week.  Being an adopter and advocate of serverless computing, my favourite announcement was [AWS Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html){:target="_blank"} and [Custom AWS Lambda Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html){:target="_blank"}.  You can read [the blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-use-any-programming-language-and-share-common-components/){:target="_blank"} from [Danilo](https://twitter.com/danilop){:target="_blank"} for more details.

This allowed developers to bring new languages to Lambda, check out these solutions :

- a [C++](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-the-c-lambda-runtime/){:target="_blank"} runtime (build by AWS)
- a [Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/){:target="_blank"} runtime (build by AWS)
- a [PHP](https://www.stackery.io/blog/aws-lambda-php/){:target="_blank"} runtime (provided by Stackery)
- a [Swift](https://github.com/tonisuter/aws-lambda-swift){:target="_blank"} runtime (opensource, built by [Toni Suter](https://tonisuter.com/){:target="_blank"} from Switzerland)
- and even a [Cobol](https://www.bluage.com/news/serverless-cobol){:target="_blank"} runtime (provided by BlueAge)

And probably more to come, [let me know][me] if you have developed a custom runtime to add to this list.

See you at a re:Invent re:Cap event near you!

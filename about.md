Seb is writing code since he first touched a Commodore 64 in the mid-eighties. He is inspiring builders to unlock the value of the AWS cloud, using his secret blend of passion, enthusiasm, customer advocacy, curiosity and creativity. His interests are about software architectures, developer tools and mobile computing.

Before joining the AWS Evangelist team, Seb built & lead the [AWS technical training][awstc] team in EMEA, and the [Alexa solution architecture][alexadev] team in UK, France, Italy and Spain.

If you want to sell him something, be sure it has an API.
